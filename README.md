Great Experiences on Any Device

In this course you'll learn the fundamentals of responsive web design with Google's Pete LePage! You'll create your own responsive web page that works well on any device - phone, tablet, desktop or anything in between.

You’ll start by exploring what makes a site responsive and how some common responsive design patterns work across different devices. 

From there, you’ll learn how to create your own responsive layout using the viewport tag and CSS media queries. 

As you proceed, you’ll experiment with major and minor breakpoints, and optimizing text for reading.

Gulp, Sass, and BabelJS, Oh My!

In this course, you’ll learn how to setup your development, get super productive during daily work and iteration, prevent yourself and your site from disasters and save a lot of time and effort with automatic optimization and automation. 

Finally, you’ll learn how to do all this while being confident your code runs on a multitude of devices in the real world.

Developing with Empathy

In this course you’ll get hands-on experience making web applications accessible. 

You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility. 

Then you’ll dive into the "how": making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.) 

You’ll understand what "semantics" and "semantic markup" mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. 

Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.

This course is also featured in our Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The Critical Rendering Path

You will learn how to optimize any website for speed by diving into the details of how mobile and desktop browsers render pages.

In this short course, you’ll learn about the Critical Rendering Path, or the set of steps browsers must take to convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into living, breathing websites. 

From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to measure performance and simple strategies to deliver the first pixels to the screen as early as possible. 

You’ll learn how to dive into recommendations from PageSpeed Insights and the Timeline view of Google Chrome’s Developer Tools to find the data you need to achieve immediate performance boosts!

This course is also a part of our Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## 5. Offline Web Applications
byGoogle

Using IndexedDB & Service Worker


This course is focused squarely on user experience, and seeks to show developers how thinking offline-first is the best way to ensure that applications perform their best in all scenarios, not just ideal ones. 

You'll learn to recognize the differences between good, poor, intermittent, and missing connectivity for your users , and master how to make applications that navigate these conditions with ease.

Using the skills you master in this course, you'll conclude by building an app that that works both online and offline, and loads in new data when it can. You'll be a master of the cache! 

Your web apps will interact with the network just like native apps do. 

This will lead to better user experiences even in traditionally challenging connection scenarios like being stuck in a train tunnel, having to rely on over-crowded conference Wi-Fi, or traveling through a cellular "dead zone!"
