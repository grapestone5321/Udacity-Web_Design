Great Experiences on Any Device

In this course you'll learn the fundamentals of responsive web design with Google's Pete LePage! You'll create your own responsive web page that works well on any device - phone, tablet, desktop or anything in between.

You’ll start by exploring what makes a site responsive and how some common responsive design patterns work across different devices. 

From there, you’ll learn how to create your own responsive layout using the viewport tag and CSS media queries. 

As you proceed, you’ll experiment with major and minor breakpoints, and optimizing text for reading.

Gulp, Sass, and BabelJS, Oh My!

In this course, you’ll learn how to setup your development, get super productive during daily work and iteration, prevent yourself and your site from disasters and save a lot of time and effort with automatic optimization and automation. 

Finally, you’ll learn how to do all this while being confident your code runs on a multitude of devices in the real world.

Developing with Empathy

In this course you’ll get hands-on experience making web applications accessible. 

You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility. 

Then you’ll dive into the "how": making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.) 

You’ll understand what "semantics" and "semantic markup" mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. 

Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.

This course is also featured in our Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.
